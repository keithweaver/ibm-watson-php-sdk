generally recognized that stable combustion processes in heated boundary layers may be achieved by either of two conceptual mechanisms . in one mechanism it is pictured that the heat transfer to the wall quenches the propagating flame at a certain distance from the surface . the equality between the flow velocity and the normal burning velocity at this quenching distance determines the position of the propagating flame . in the second mechanism it is conceived that the hot surface provides a continuous source of ignition in much the same manner that the hot recirculation zone of a bluff body flame holder provides continuous ignition to the gas flowing around it . in this case it is the characteristic time during which the gas must be heated that determines the position of the flame . all experimental work reported to date has been concerned with conditions where the first picture has apparently been applicable . in the present paper, experiment and analysis are given that show under what conditions the continuous ignition mechanism provides the appropriate model and also how the two models are related . to differentiate the two mechanisms an experiment was set up to study flame stabilization in high-velocity boundary layers over a wall heated in the form of a step function . with a turbulent boundary layer and a wall temperature above 1,700f., the characteristic time was found to be a systematic and reproducible variable . these observations led to the conclusion that a continuous ignition mechanism governs stabilization in heated turbulent boundary layers . a rational explanation is made for the transition from the low-speed mechanism known to be applicable in unheated turbulent boundary layers and heated laminar boundary layers to the ignition mechanism applicable in heated turbulent boundary layers . as a further verification of the continuous ignition mechanism an apparent ignition energy was found . the logarithm of the heat added at the lower stability limit was found to be a linear function of the reciprocal of the limiting wall temperature . the activation energy derived from this arrhenius type of relation agreed reasonably well with the estimated value for the fuel used . ) [title] => Array ( [0] => stable combustion of a high-velocity gas in a heated boundary layer . ) [_version_] => 1559999081443491841 ) [2] => stdClass Object

with shock waves . a study is made of the unsteady flow around an airfoil at transonic mach numbers, the situation being such that local supersonic regions terminated by shock-waves are present in the vicinity of the airfoil . for the unsteady part of the flow, small perturbations technique is employed and the interaction with the shock wave is taken into account . the case of an oscillating aileron is considered first, and a solution is derived for the pressure distribution on the aileron . it is found that the solution has a simple form when the shock-wave is well ahead of the hinge axis of the aileron . as the shock approaches the hinge-axis a correction must be added to the solution . an interpretation of these results is given . the results are compared with results of a theory which neglects the presence of the shock and it is found that both agree for m = 1 . for m 1, however, neglecting the presence of the shock waves introduces errors of the order of magnitude (1 - m), where m is the local mach number behind the shock . the theory is finally extended to include the case in which the whole airfoil oscillates, but only the solution for the subsonic region behind the shock is treated . the role of the unsteady shock-boundary layer interaction is discussed and it is shown that this mechanism can be included in the results of the present theory . ) [title] =>

cause large /magnus/ effects on a finned missile whose wings are deflected into an aileron setting . a simple experimental method with water as the working medium is used to obtain low-speed magnus data on a rolling missile . the missile is a slender cruciform configuration with all-movable wings and fixed tail fins . magnus data are presented for angles of attack up to 15 and for the one (high) roll rate which accompanies a 30 aileron deflection angle of the wings . tests conducted at zero roll rate but with the wing deflection maintained, revealed large forces in the magnus direction, thereby providing the basis for understanding magnus effects due to wing-tail interference . a semiempirical theory is proposed to explain the experimental data . a simplified model of the wake behind the wings is introduced to predict tail-interference factors . good agreement with the data is obtained . this magnus effect is opposite in direction to the classical magnus lift on a spinning cylinder ,. it is much larger than either that effect or the one on a missile with only one set of fins . wing-tail interference is the predominant source of the effect ,. roll rate only modifies the

aileron angle and position of transition on the wing . variation with frequency parameter is substantially the same as for vortex-sheet theory and variation of amplitude produces little change in both derivatives . at the lowest reynolds number there is little change in both derivatives with variation of aileron angle for the condition of natural transition, but at higher reynolds numbers the stiffness derivatives increase at . a forward movement of transition reduces the stiffness derivatives at the smaller aileron angles, but at, at the lowest reynolds number, an increase results . similar trends are observed for the damping derivatives above . comparison with vortex-sheet theory shows that the measured values of the stiffness and damping derivatives are approximately 0.6 of the theoretical values . measurements have been made of the direct tab derivatives and cross aileron-tab derivatives for a per cent aileron and 4 per cent (approx.) tab . in addition some measurements of

analytic investigation of laminar combustion processes which are essentially two- or three-dimensional present some mathematical difficulties . there are, however, several examples of two-dimensional flame propagation which involve transverse velocities that are small in comparison with that in the principal direction of flow . such examples occur in the problem of flame quenching by a cool surface, flame stabilization on a heated flat plate, combustion in laminar mixing zones, etc . in these cases the problem may be simplified by employing what is known in fluid mechanics as the boundary-layer approximation, since it was applied first by prandtl in his treatment of the viscous flow over a flat plate . physically it consists in recognizing that if the transverse velocity is small, the variations of flow properties along the direction of main flow are small in comparison with those in a direction normal to the main flow . the analytic description of the problem simplifies accordingly . the present analysis considers the ignition and combustion in the laminar mixing zone between two parallel moving gas streams . one stream consists of a cool combustible mixture, the second is hot combustion products . the two streams come into contact at a given point and a laminar mixing process follows in which the velocity distribution is modified by viscosity, and the temperature and composition distributions by conduction, diffusion, and chemical reaction . the decomposition of the combustible stream is assumed to follow first-order reaction kinetics with temperature dependence according to the arrhenius law . for a given initial velocity, composition, and temperature distribution, the questions to be answered are .. (1) does the combustible material ignite,. and (2) how far downstream of the initial contact point does the flame appear and what is the detailed process of development . since the hot stream is of infinite extent, it is found that ignition always takes place at some point of the stream . however, when the temperature of the hot stream drops below a certain value, the distance required for ignition increases so enormously that it essentially does not occur in a physical apparatus of finite dimension . the complete development of the laminar flame front is computed using an approximation similar to the integral technique introduced by von karman into boundary layer theory . ) [title] => Array ( [0] => ignition and combustion in a laminar mixing zone . ) [_version_] =>

formation of a blast wave by a very intense explosion . this paper was written early in 1941 and circulated to the civil defence research committee of the ministry of home security in june of that year . the present writer had been told that it might be possible to produce a bomb in which a very large amount of energy would be released by nuclear fission--the name atomic bomb had not then been used--and the work here described represents his first attempt to form an idea of what mechanical effects might be expected if such an explosion could occur . in the then common explosive bomb mechanical effects were produced by the sudden generation of a large amount of gas at a high temperature in a confined space . the practical question which required an answer was .. would similar effects be produced if energy could be released in a highly concentrated form unaccompanied by the generation of gas .qm this paper has now been declassified, and though it has been superseded by more complete calculations, it seems appropriate to publish it as it was first written, without alteration, except for the omission of a few lines, the addition of this summary, and a comparison with some more recent experimental work, so that the writings of later workers in this field may be appreciated . an ideal problem is here discussed . a finite amount of energy is suddenly released in an infinitely concentrated form . the motion and pressure of the surrounding air is calculated . it is found that a spherical shock wave is propagated outwards whose radius r is related to the time t since the explosion started by the equation where is the atmospheric density, e is the energy released and s a calculated function of, the ratio of the specific heats of air . the effect of the explosion is to force most of the air within the shock front into a thin shell just inside that front . as the front expands, the maximum pressure decreases till, at about 10 atm., the analysis ceases to be accurate . at 20 atm. 45 of the energy has been degraded into heat which is not available for doing work and used up in expanding against atmospheric pressure . this leads to the prediction that an atomic bomb would be only half as efficient, as a blast-producer, as a high explosive releasing the same amount of energy . in the ideal problem the maximum pressure is proportional to r, and comparison with the measured pressures near high explosives, in the range of radii where the two might be expected to be comparable, shows that these conclusions are borne out by experiment . )

calculating approximately the inviscid rotational flow field and pressure distribution about a smooth two-dimensional airfoil with sharp leading and trailing edges in a uniform supersonic or hypersonic stream . the assumption of a perfect gas is made, and the basic flow pattern for the analysis is taken to be given by the simple isentropic shock-expansion method with straight characteristics . an elementary characteristics treatment is discussed to show when the simple shock-expansion method should be satisfactory for computing the surface pressure distribution, and under what circumstances it may be expected to break down . by utilizing characteristic variables the isentropic shock-expansion method is then formulated analytically, and an analytic result is obtained for the shock shape corresponding to this zero-order approximation . in the special case where hypersonic similitude is applicable, that is, for slender bodies and high mach numbers, the shock-shape expression for large distances is found to reduce to the result previously given by mahony, which for weak shocks and slender bodies in turn reduces to the simple-wave result first given by friedrichs . employing the analytic form of the isentropic shock-expansion method as a zero-order approximation, an analytically consistent perturbation method is developed by expanding the dependent flow variables in the exact partial differential equations in powers of the reflection coefficient for simple waves interacting with an oblique shock . the scheme by its nature helps to define those regions in which shock expansion can be used, in addition to taking into account in a perturbation sense the factors neglected in simple shock-expansion theory, namely, the curvature and reflection of the mach waves and the correct boundary conditions at the shock wave . analytic solutions are obtained for the first-order corrections, including the surface pressure distribution . the necessary numerical computation of the integrals involved is considerably simpler than a direct application of the method of characteristics . to illustrate the method and its accuracy, the zero-order shock shape and first-order pressure distribution are calculated for a family of parabolic arc airfoils at an infinite free-stream mach number . these results are compared with rotational characteristic solutions where available, and the present method is found to be in excellent agreement . ) [title] => Array ( [0] => an analytic extension of the shock-expansion method . ) [_version_] =>
